# 👁️‍🗨️ Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to **Vision_Projects**, a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Computer Vision projects developed using **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and other powerful libraries. These projects demonstrate real-time applications such as face detection, hand tracking, gesture-based volume control, and attendance marking using face recognition.

Whether you're a curious beginner or an aspiring developer, these mini-projects will help you understand how powerful computer vision can be! 💻📷
